## Hardware required

- CPU: 2 cores or more
- RAM: min 6Gb (for JDK 64-bit) or min 3Gb (for JDK 32-bit)

## Software installed required

- JDK: 1.7.0_x or newer (can require of removing of some unsupported JVM options from test configuration)
- Maven: 3.0.4 or sbt: 0.12.3

## Building & running benchmarks

Use following command-line instructions to build from sources and run benchmarks with Scala's ForkJoinPool in FIFO mode:
```sh
mvn -B clean test >outX.txt
```
or
```sh
sbt clean test >outX.txt
```

To run benchmarks for all available types of executor service use mvnAll.bat or mvnAll.sh scripts.
